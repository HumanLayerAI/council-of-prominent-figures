## What It Does

A live, interactive Claude artifact that simulates structured deliberation among historically and intellectually prominent figures. The system analyzes complex questions by forcing **explicit disagreement, assumption testing, and epistemic accountability** before producing a synthesized conclusion.

Rather than generating a single coherent response, the artifact orchestrates multiple constrained reasoning voices, each representing a distinct intellectual lens (law, psychology, strategy, ethics, technology), and resolves their conflict through a controlled synthesis layer.

## Why I Made This

Single-voice AI systems tend to optimize for surface coherence, which can mask flawed assumptions, bias, or overconfident reasoning—especially in legal, policy, or psychological contexts.

This artifact exists to demonstrate how **structured disagreement** can be used as a design feature to improve reasoning quality, interpretability, and trustworthiness in AI-assisted decision workflows.

## Key Features

- Multi-persona prompt architecture and role-bounded reasoning
- - Adversarial and second-order thinking under uncertainty
  - - Bias exposure through forced disagreement
    - - Hallucination resistance through explicit disagreement
      - - Controlled synthesis and decision accountability
